Identity and Access Management

Identity and what is allowed by them

User -> Group, Role and Policy

Group is a way to organize user
Policy define permission
User can get permission directly or via group
Roles are for delegation and are assumed
With assumed roles you can talk to other services

Root User(sign up AWS acc) has full permission
-> should be avoided and enable MFA

Create new User
-> no permission by default
-> you can create around 5000 accounts (+more)
-> Use policies and prefer group
-> Amazon resource Name ARN & Regular name
-> User name and password or access keys (CLI)


Create Groups

Admin -> Policy1
Developer -> Policy2
Tester -> Policy3

-> Add policy to group
-> Add permission to group
-> User gets permission via group
-> Least privilege possible

IAM Roles
-> Roles are assumed by users, applications and services
-> Imagine to become PM for 1 day
-> Gain the permission for role only

IAM Policies

-> Policies are JSON Documents
-> Implicitly Denied
-> Identity based and resource based
-> AWS support 6 types of policies

> identity based policy
> resource based policy
> permission boundaries
> organization service control policy
> access control list
> session policy


IAM Best Practices

> Use MFA
> Rotate Keys and passwords
> Do not use Root account
> Least privilege permission
> IAM Access Analyzer: Tool to generate least privilege policy based
on access activity
> Regularly remove user, roles, permission, policy and credentials
> conditions like IP-range or geo-location can be applied
