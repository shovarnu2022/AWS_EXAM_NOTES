Identity and Access Management

Identity and what is allowed by them

User -> Group, Role and Policy

Group is a way to organize user
Policy define permission
User can get permission directly or via group
Roles are for delegation and are assumed
With assumed roles you can talk to other services

Root User(sign up AWS acc) has full permission
-> should be avoided and enable MFA

Create new User
-> no permission by default
-> you can create arounf 5000 accounts (+more)
-> User policies and prefer group
-> Amazon resource Name ARN & Regular name
-> User name and password or access keys (CLI)
